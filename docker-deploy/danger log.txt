Danger log:
1. We utilize multi-threads to handle some concurrent requests at the same time,
but we cannot handle a huge number of concurrent requests.
2. Our proxy is not friendly to chunked transfer encoding.
3. At first, we did not assign a number to each request. Instead, we only have a counter in Proxy class. However, this led to the incorrectness of the log. Then we assigned a number to each request to fix this issue.
4. When we wanted to assign a number to each request, we add a attribute named id to Request class. However id is a key word. After we realized this problem, we changed the name.
5. Only support HTTP and HTTPS protocols.
6. The time showed on the log is not the local time.
7. We tried to achieve strong guarantees.

Cache:
1. The fields of a response has multiple forms and we only care about Cache-Control, Segma, Etag and max-age fields. When other fields appears, or one field has too many attributes, the expire time for a response may exsit errors.
2. For chunk field and content-length field, we didn't do specific recognition. When serveral chunked responses come, we may not receive all of them.
3. An expired response stored in cache would not be erased from the cache.
